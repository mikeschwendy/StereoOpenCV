# StereoOpenCV
Stereo processing of ocean wave images, written in c++ with OpenCV

This is code written to test the functionality of OpenCV, for use in stereo video processing of ship-based video of ocean waves.

The code in StereoOpenCV/SingleStereo processes a single pair of stereo images

StereoOpenCV/CameraCalibration runs a calibration for determining intrinsic and extrinsic parameters for individual cameras and stereo camera pairs.

StereoOpenCV/mexStereo allows for the stereo processing to be called from Matlab.

StereoOpenCV/OpenCVTest is a simple test of OpenCV, to be sure the installation is correct.
